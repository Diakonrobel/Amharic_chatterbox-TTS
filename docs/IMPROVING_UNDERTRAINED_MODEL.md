# Improving an Undertrained Model (0.6 Hours Dataset)

## 🎯 Problem

You trained a model on **0.6 hours** (~36 minutes) of Amharic data, but the audio still sounds like noise/machine sounds.

**Why:** 0.6 hours is **too little data** for the model to learn proper Amharic speech patterns.

---

## 📊 Data Requirements

| Dataset Size | Quality | Use Case |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| < 1 hour | ❌ Poor | Testing only |
| 1-5 hours | ⚠️ Basic | Proof of concept |
| 5-10 hours | ✓ Good | Usable quality |
| 10-20 hours | ✅ Very Good | Production quality |
| 20+ hours | 🌟 Excellent | Professional quality |

**Your current:** 0.6 hours ❌  
**Recommended minimum:** 5+ hours ✅

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Add More Data (BEST)

### Collect More Amharic Speech:

1. **SRT from YouTube videos:**
   - Find Amharic videos with subtitles
   - Use the Dataset Import tab
   - Target: 5-10 hours total

2. **Record your own:**
   - Read Amharic text
   - Record in quiet environment
   - Use good microphone

3. **Use existing datasets:**
   - Ethiopian radio broadcasts
   - Audiobooks in Amharic
   - News programs with transcriptions

### How to add more data:

```bash
# In Gradio UI:
1. Go to "Dataset Import" tab
2. Upload SRT + media files
3. Import multiple datasets
4. Merge all datasets together
5. Re-train with combined data
```

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Train Much Longer

Even with limited data, you can improve quality by training longer:

### On Lightning AI:

```bash
# Analyze current checkpoint
python scripts/analyze_checkpoint.py models/checkpoints/checkpoint_latest.pt

# Resume training
python src/training/train.py \
    --config config/training_config.yaml \
    --resume models/checkpoints/checkpoint_latest.pt
```

### Target Training Metrics:

| Metric | Current | Target | Quality |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| Loss | ? | < 2.0 | Basic |
| Loss | ? | < 1.0 | Good |
| Loss | ? | < 0.5 | Excellent |
| Epochs | ? | 500-1000 | Minimum |

**Check your current loss:** It's likely still > 5.0, which is why audio sounds like noise.

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Optimize Training Config

Lower the learning rate for better convergence:

Edit `config/training_config.yaml`:

```yaml
training:
  learning_rate: 5e-5  # Lower from 2e-4
  batch_size: 8        # Smaller for limited data
  max_epochs: 2000     # Train much longer
  early_stopping: true
  patience: 50
```

---

## 📈 Expected Improvement Timeline

### With 0.6 hours data:
```
Epochs 1-50:   Loss ~10 → Audio: noise
Epochs 50-200: Loss ~5  → Audio: some sounds recognizable
Epochs 200-500: Loss ~2  → Audio: speech-like but unclear
Epochs 500-1000: Loss ~1 → Audio: partially intelligible
Epochs 1000+:   Loss ~0.8 → Audio: mostly intelligible (but limited)
```

**Problem:** Even at loss < 1.0, quality will be limited by the small dataset.

### With 5+ hours data:
```
Epochs 1-50:   Loss ~10 → Audio: noise
Epochs 50-200: Loss ~3  → Audio: recognizable speech patterns
Epochs 200-500: Loss ~1  → Audio: clear speech
Epochs 500+:   Loss ~0.5 → Audio: excellent quality
```

## 🎯 Quick Action Plan

### Option A: Add More Data (Recommended)

1. **Collect 5+ hours** of Amharic speech
2. **Import** using Dataset Import tab
3. **Merge** with existing 0.6 hours
4. **Resume training** from checkpoint
5. **Train for 500+ epochs**
6. **Result:** Good quality speech ✅

**Time:** Data collection (varies) + Training (8-16 hours)

---

### Option B: Train Current Model Longer

1. **Resume from checkpoint_latest.pt**
2. **Lower learning rate** to 5e-5
3. **Train for 1000+ epochs**
4. **Monitor loss** until < 1.0
5. **Result:** Basic intelligible speech ⚠️

**Time:** Training (24-48 hours)  
**Limitation:** Quality ceiling due to limited data

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best)

1. **Train current model** for 500 more epochs (overnight)
2. **Meanwhile collect** more data (5+ hours)
3. **Merge datasets** and resume training
4. **Train combined** for 500+ epochs
5. **Result:** Excellent quality speech 🌟

**Time:** 1-2 days total  
**Benefit:** Continuous improvement

## 🔍 How to Check Training Progress

### Method 1: Monitor Loss

```bash
# On Lightning AI, watch training logs
# Look for:
Training loss: 5.234  # Still too high
Training loss: 2.156  # Getting better
Training loss: 0.987  # Good!
```

### Method 2: Test Inference Periodically

```bash
# Every 100 epochs, test inference:
python src/inference/inference.py \
    --checkpoint models/checkpoints/checkpoint_latest.pt \
    --text "ሰላም ለዓለም" \
    --output test_epoch_100.wav

# Listen and compare to previous epochs
```

### Method 3: TensorBoard

```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs
# Open browser to http://localhost:6006
# Watch loss curve in real-time
```

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### On Lightning AI RIGHT NOW:

1. **Check current training status:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_checkpoint.py models/checkpoints/checkpoint_latest.pt
   ```

2. **If loss > 2.0, resume training:**
   ```bash
   # In Gradio UI:
   - Go to "Training Pipeline"
   - Select "checkpoint_latest.pt" for resume
   - Lower learning rate to 5e-5
   - Click "Start Training"
   - Let it run for 500+ epochs
   ```

3. **Test every 100 epochs:**
   ```bash
   # Stop training briefly
   # Test inference in TTS tab
   # If improving, continue
   # If not, adjust learning rate
   ```

4. **Meanwhile, collect more data:**
   - Find Amharic videos with SRT
   - Import in "Dataset Import" tab
   - Merge with existing dataset

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't give up after 50 epochs**
   - TTS models need 500-1000 epochs minimum
   - Especially with limited data

2. **Lower learning rate helps**
   - 2e-4 → 5e-5 → 1e-5 as training progresses
   - Prevents overshooting optimal weights

3. **Monitor validation loss**
   - If val_loss stops improving, try:
     * Lower learning rate
     * Add more data
     * Enable dropout

4. **Quality = Data × Training**
   - More data beats more training
   - But more training helps with limited data
   - Best results: Both!

## 🎯 Summary

**Your situation:**
- ✅ Inference pipeline works
- ✅ Model architecture correct
- ⚠️ Dataset too small (0.6 hours)
- ❌ Model undertrained (loss still high)

**Best solution:**
1. Add 5-10 hours more Amharic data
2. Resume training with combined dataset
3. Train for 500+ epochs
4. Monitor loss until < 1.0
5. Enjoy clear Amharic speech! 🎉

**Quick solution (if can't get more data):**
1. Resume training from checkpoint
2. Lower learning rate to 5e-5
3. Train for 1000+ epochs
4. Accept limited quality (basic intelligibility)

**Good luck!** With more data and training, your model will sound great! 🎙️🇪🇹✨
