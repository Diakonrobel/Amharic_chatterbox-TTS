## 🎯 What Needs to Be Done

Your training script currently has **dummy placeholders** for the forward pass and loss computation. To start real training, you need to **replace these with actual model calls**.

### Required Changes

The following changes are needed in `src/training/train.py`:

1. **Add `setup_dataloaders()` function** to properly initialize data pipeline
2. **Initialize `criterion` (TTSLoss)** in the main training function
3. **Replace dummy forward pass** with real model inference
4. **Update validation loop** to use real model evaluation
5. **Pass `criterion` and `writer`** to training functions
6. **Add detailed TensorBoard metrics** (optional)

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Medium (mostly search-and-replace)

5. ✓ Use `CODE_CHANGES_REFERENCE.md` to copy exact code
6. ✓ Check off items in `TRAINING_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md` as you go
7. ✓ Run syntax check after each major change:
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile src/training/train.py
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing (10 minutes)
8. ✓ Create a minimal test config (2-3 samples, 1 epoch)
9. ✓ Run training for 1-2 steps to verify it works
10. ✓ Check that loss values are realistic (not dummy negatives)
11. ✓ Verify checkpoint saving works

### Phase 4: Full Training
12. ✓ Update config with full dataset and proper hyperparameters
13. ✓ Start training and monitor logs
14. ✓ Check TensorBoard for loss curves

## 📊 Expected Results After Implementation

### Before (Current - Dummy Training)
```
[12:34:56] Epoch 1 | Step 1 | Loss: -0.1234 | Avg: -0.1234 | LR: 0.000100
[12:34:57] Epoch 1 | Step 2 | Loss: -0.5678 | Avg: -0.3456 | LR: 0.000100
```
- Loss values are negative and meaningless
- No actual model training happening
- Just infrastructure testing

### After (Real Training)
```
[12:34:56] Setting up SimplifiedT3Model...
[12:34:57] ✓ Extended embeddings loaded
[12:34:58] Setting up dataloaders...
[12:34:59] ✓ Loaded 310 samples from metadata.csv

```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 8           # Adjust based on GPU memory
  learning_rate: 0.0001   # Conservative starting point
  max_epochs: 1000        # Long training
  max_steps: 100000       # Or use step limit

  n_vocab: 2XXX           # Base + Amharic tokens
  freeze_original_embeddings: true  # Transfer learning
  freeze_until_index: 2000          # Freeze base tokens
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues During Implementation

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `collate_fn not found` | Verify import: `from src.audio import collate_fn` |
| `setup_dataloaders not defined` | Add function from Step 2 of guide |
| Function signature mismatch | Check all calls updated with new parameters |
| Loss is NaN | Reduce learning rate, check data normalization |
| CUDA out of memory | Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation |

### Testing Tips

1. **Start small:** Test with 2-3 samples first
2. **Check logs:** Watch for realistic loss values
3. **Monitor GPU:** Ensure GPU is being utilized
4. **Verify checkpoints:** Make sure they're being saved

---

## 📈 Training Progress Monitoring

Once training starts:

### Console Logs
Watch for:
- Decreasing loss values
- No NaN or Inf losses
- Regular checkpoint saves
- Stable learning rate schedule

### TensorBoard (if enabled)
```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/
```
Monitor:
- Training loss curves (total, mel, duration)
- Validation loss
- Learning rate schedule

### Checkpoints
Location: `checkpoints/`
- Latest checkpoint: `checkpoint_latest.pt`
- Epoch checkpoints: `checkpoint_epoch{N}_step{M}.pt`

---

## 🎓 Training Best Practices

1. **Start with pretrained model** (transfer learning)
2. **Freeze base embeddings** initially
3. **Monitor validation loss** closely
4. **Save checkpoints frequently** (every 100-500 steps)
5. **Test generated audio** periodically
6. **Adjust learning rate** if needed
7. **Use gradient clipping** (already configured)

## ✨ Next Steps After Training

Once you have a trained model:

1. **Inference Script** - Create script to generate speech
2. **Evaluation Metrics** - Compute MOS, WER, etc.
3. **Demo App** - Build Gradio/Streamlit interface
4. **Fine-tune Hyperparameters** - Optimize based on results
5. **Expand Dataset** - Add more Amharic samples
6. **Model Compression** - Quantize for deployment
